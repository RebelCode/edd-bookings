        <p>
            If you're updating from EDD Bookings v1.0.3 or earlier, you'll find that we've updated your Downloads and
            created an Availability and Timetable for each of your downloads that have bookings enabled, to preserve
            their functionality on your site. <i>Nothing's changed, but everything's new!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your calendar builder settings have been converted into Timetables, each of which is assigned to its own
            Availability. We still encourage you to go over your settings and tweak them to your needs. This will help
            you familiarise yourself with the new features.

        <h3>Availabilities</h3>
        <p>
            Your downloads now no longer have their own calendar settings and bookings. Instead, your downloads
            now have an <strong>availability</strong>, which is virtually identical to a real-life diary. Bookings
            made for that download are recorded in its availability.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also set up multiple downloads to use the same availability, so that booked times for one download
            cannot be booked for another.

        <h3>Timetables</h3>
        <p>
            A timetable is exactly what the name says it is: a definition of the dates and times your customers are
            allowed to book. This was previously known as the Calendar Builder, found in the download's Edit page.
            If you've used EDD Bookings v1.0.3 or earlier, then this will be familiar territory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each one of your availabilities is linked to a timetable, and multiple availabilities can share a single
            timetable!

                A calendar preview for the Timetable editor is in the works, to reflect changes while you edit. We're
                also looking to make a few adjustments to the interface, making it more intuitive.

                planned for future versions. Our aim is to make your WordPress Admin feel like a booking system.
